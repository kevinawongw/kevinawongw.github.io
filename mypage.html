    <h1>Wong, Kevina</h1>
    <p>I am obsessed with coffee and drinks, and I think it would be fun to be a barista. I have travelled to 7 countries. I enjoy cooking! I am studying computer science because I think that it is a huge part of the present and future, so it will be very beneficial to know how it works.</p>
